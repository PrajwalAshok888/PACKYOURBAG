# PACKYOURBAG
Description of the "Pack Your Bags" Android Project:

- The "Pack Your Bags" project is a mobile app designed to help users create a packing list for their trips and travels.

- The app consists of three main activities: MainActivity, BlankActivity, and NewBlankActivity.

- MainActivity serves as the entry point of the app. It displays a simple interface with a "BAG" button.

- Upon clicking the "BAG" button in MainActivity, the user is taken to BlankActivity. In BlankActivity, the user can add items to their packing list using an EditText and an "Add" button.

- The packing items are displayed in a RecyclerView, allowing the user to see their list dynamically as they add items.

- The app stores the packing items in SharedPreferences, so the user's list is saved even if they close the app.

- In BlankActivity, the user can select specific items from the packing list by checking the checkboxes next to each item. The selected items are stored in a Set.

- The selected items can be viewed and managed in NewBlankActivity. This activity displays a toolbar with a "Back" button, and below it is a list of the selected items in a RecyclerView.

- In NewBlankActivity, the user can also click the "Home" button to return to MainActivity and the "Delete All" button to clear all selected items.

- The project uses various layout files, including activity_main.xml, activity_blank.xml, activity_new_blank.xml, item_packing.xml, and list_item.xml, to define the UI elements and appearance of each activity.

- The app uses custom RecyclerView adapters, such as PackingListAdapter and ItemAdapter, to handle the data and display the list of packing items.

- The project incorporates several button click listeners and item selection logic to manage the user's interactions with the app effectively.

- Overall, the "Pack Your Bags" app provides a convenient and user-friendly way for travelers to create and manage their packing lists for different trips.
